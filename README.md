## Getting Started

This site is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). Follow the instructions in this section to set up your local environment.

### Prerequisite

Before starting, ensure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) version 22.0 or higher and the latest version of [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) installed on your machine.

### Local Environment Setup

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the [VC-Community-Docs repository](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Community-Docs) to your own GitHub account.
2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the forked repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/VC-Community-Docs.git
   ```

3. Navigate to and open the project in your code editor.

   ```bash
   cd VC-Community-Docs
   ```

4. Create a new branch to work on your changes. Do NOT work directly on the `main` branch.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b YOUR-BRANCH-NAME
   ```

   Replace "YOUR-BRANCH-NAME" with a descriptive name for your branch â€” for example, `feat/add-template`.

5. Install the dependencies and run the project.

### Local Development

Running the project locally is essential to see your changes in real time and test them thoroughly when you're contributing.

1. Install the dependencies and run the project locally

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm start
   ```

2. Open the project at `http://localhost:3000/docs` on your browser after the local development server is ready

3. Make and test changes

   With the local server running, you can make changes to the files and immediately see the results in your browser. Test your changes thoroughly.

4. Stop the server

   After completing and testing the changes, you can stop the local server by pressing `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

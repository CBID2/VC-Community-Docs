## Hacktoberfest.virtualcoffee.io

- Add a field for time zone for mentors and contribs if they want mentorship
- Set clear dates for opening and closing registration
- Brainstorm different approaches to pairing (mentor pairing mixer or self-selection of mentors -- for example, a list of each mentor with their specialties, availibilities, etc. Then a mentee can select which mentor they want, but the button or whatever used to select will be disabled)

# Guide to Accountabilibuddies

## History

Accountabilibuddies began when Meg and two other VC members decided to pick a time to meet to do job searching activities together because let's face it – the job search is a SLOG. It was much more bearable when in the presence of company. Our group grew as more members joined and eventually Meg found a JOB! However, she didn't want to stop hosting Accountabilibuddies – so many people found refuge in this space – so it became advertised as a more general accountability group for those wanting a block of time set aside each week to get things done.

## Host Duties

### Set Up

You may enter the Zoom up to 10 minutes before the start of the event.

If you make a Slack post for your weekly Accountabilibuddies session, do this now to let people know you're starting soon. Share it in some other relevant channels as well for a broader reach.

#### Claiming Host

When you arrive in the Zoom, enter the Host Code to claim host privledges. To do this, navigate to the `#vc-events-admin` channel in Slack and copy the Host Code from the posted Accountabilibuddies event. Back in Zoom, open the Participants tab and click on the 'Claim host' button to input the code.

Once your co-host enters the Zoom, hover over their name in the Participants tab and click the 'More ▿' button. Select the 'Make co-host' option to grant them co-host privledges.

> [!WARNING]
> As Zoom host, if you leave the Zoom, you will end the call for all participants! If you have to leave early, be sure to pass host privledges to your co-host by following the steps above and selecting 'Make host' before exiting the Zoom call.

#### Creating Breakout Rooms

It's important to create breakout rooms for attendees who need an alternative space. It may be to concentrate if it gets too chatty in the main room, screenshare and debug an issue, or practice an upcoming presentation. Whatever the need, we as hosts should try our best to fulfill it.

Once you claim host in Zoom, you'll see a 'Breakout rooms' tab. When you select this, a pop-up will appear with options. Be sure to select the following:

- Allow participants to choose room
- Allow participants to return to the main session at any time

Then, select the number of breakout rooms you want to create. We usually go with three and rename them on the next screen to:

- **Focus room**
- **Pair programming**
- Something to do with the current monthly challenge (if applicable)

Don't forget to click on 'Open all rooms' when you're finished creating them!

### Greeting Attendees

Each Accountabilibuddies session has its handful of regulars, but we get new attendees from time to time as well! When this happens, explain to them what Accountabilibuddies is all about. Here's a blurb to help you:

> Accountabilibuddies is a Coffee Table Group meant to act as a timeblock in your calendar each week for you to get things done. Everyone here arrives with their own tasks, TODOs, and projects and gets to work, giving each other support and updates on their individual progress along the way. You become not only accountable to yourself, but also your friends you meet here every week!

Let them know that there are breakout rooms available for them to use and that they can go to a breakout room and rejoin the main room at their will. Lastly, inform them of the regularly scheduled Accountabilibuddies session time and let them know that they're welcome to come and go as they please during this time.

If you make a Slack post for your Accountabilibuddies session, ask them if they would like to be added to the weekly Slack reminder post as well!

### Lateness/Abesenteeism

Be sure to arrive to the session on time. If you can't make a session, or you'll be running late, check in with your co-host to make sure they'll be present. If you both have a conflict, drop a message in the `#vc-accountabilibuddies-hosts` Slack channel to see if any of the other hosts can cover for you. If not, Meg will cancel the session.

## Vibe Dictates Itinerary

Each Accountabilibuddies group has different regulars and a different vibe. When deciding an itinerary for Accountabilibuddies, we've found it's best to feel out the group and structure it around what works for the natural flow of the group.

### Tuesday Session

TBD

### Thursday Session

#### 9:00 - 9:45/10:00 AM ET

This time is akin to our random chatter before Virtual Coffee announcements. People (read: Meg) are still waking up and getting to their computers. By the first half hour, we usually have a good group online so we get some chit-chat in before settling down.

#### 10:00 – 11:40 AM ET

We've decided that 10:00 AM is our "buckle down" time and any chatter after that should be focused on helping each other with the tasks at hand. This period is treated much like the #co-working-room atmosphere. We're all mainly concentrated on our various tasks. Someone will break the silence occasionally and we chat for a few minutes, but then we get back into the workflow.

At 11:40 AM, we'll shut down the Zoom to allow attendees ample time for a Zoom break before Virtual Coffee at noon.

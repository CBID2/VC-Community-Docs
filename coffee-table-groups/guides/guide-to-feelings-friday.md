# Guide to Feelings Friday

## History

<!-- Include a history of how the group started if you'd like -->

Feelings Friday was initiated at the Flatiron School coding boot camp by its founders, Avi Flombaum and Adam Enbar, after they observed burnout among their first cohorts. During his time at Flatiron, Ethan attended various Feelings Friday. He loved that after an exhausting week, there was a recurring Friday meeting to sit with his peers and just talk, vent, and share their feelings about anything. Since joining the Virtual Coffee community, he wanted to bring that same open space online and thus started the Feelings Friday group, providing a virtual safe space for Virtual Coffee members to share their feelings on Friday evenings.

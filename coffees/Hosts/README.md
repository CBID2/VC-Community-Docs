# Hosts

## Initial Actions

- Ask the MC (or a maintainer present) to give you host permissions if you don't have them already.
- Create co-hosts for those doing room leadership/conversation facilitation by clicking on their image card in Zoom and assign co-host

### Create breakout rooms
- Click the breakout room icon,
- Select the number of rooms according to the number of potential rooms. You will be able to add rooms later if necessary.
- Choose assign **manually** (This is really important. It allows you to add people after they join.)
- Check Slack for any messages about how many rooms we need.
- We try to keep **less than 10 persons** per room. Having enough room leaders should be prioritized over having enough notetakers.
- Pair each co-host with their notetaker
- Change the name of the breakout room to the co-host/notetaker pair
- Assign members into rooms as they come in
  -  Do your best to create breakout rooms that include a variety of participant types. For example, if you know there are members who will keep the conversation going, assign them to different rooms. If there are new folks, try not to put them all in the same room. If there's a newer room leader, try to add someone to their room that could support them if they need it. The goal is to have well-balanced rooms when possible. It won't ever be perfect for every room, but the goal is to try to balance participant types.
- Once rooms are paired and opening remarks are done, click "Open All Rooms"
  _Note: The host has to assign themselves to a room_

### Once in room

- If a person joins late, a notification shows up in Breakout Rooms. Assign new attendees to a room (try to keep all about the same size).
- When there's about 7 minutes left, send a message to all rooms that we'll be rejoining the group in about two minutes
- At **ten minutes to the hour**, use the broadcast button in the Participants tab to let everyone know the rooms will be closing in 5 minutes.
- At **Five minutes to the hour**, hit the close rooms button.

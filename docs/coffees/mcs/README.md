## Before Breakout Rooms

### Pre-Chat

Welcome all new faces via chat and let them know we will get started and will be generally chatting for about 5 minutes to let everyone get settled.

**_Pre-chat chaos commences._**

### Welcome Announcements Script

> [!NOTE]
> While the welcome is happening, the Zoom host of the day creates the breakout rooms. Signal to the host to open the rooms once you've finished reading the welcome announcements.

Hello, and welcome to Virtual Coffee!

We’ve been doing this since April 2020, and we’ve loved the growth we’ve seen. Virtual Coffee's mission is to be a welcoming tech community that allows room for growth and mentorship at all levels, and to create meaningful opportunities for learning, leadership, and contribution for everyone. To find our events or to learn more, you can check out our website at [virtualcoffee.io](https://virtualcoffee.io/).

Just some quick reminders, be considerate of everyone in the group, we’re all equals here. I'm going to drop some links in the chat now and talk about them for a minute:

HANDRAISE SHORTCUT: Opt/Alt+Y
```

Sometimes what seems like an awkward silence might be an opportunity for someone else to express their thoughts.

We are an international community, and sometimes things get lost in translation. Let's lead with kindness, and recognize that the impact of our words matters. If things feel uncomfortable in any way reach out or use a Code of Conduct violation form.

We take our Code of Conduct seriously. We expect everyone to abide by the COC, whether that's during an event, in Slack, or in DMs.

We also have a COC violation submission form, which I dropped with the links. This is another option that allows you to stay anonymous when you report any violations.

We'll be moving into breakout rooms in a minute, for more intimate conversation. When you get in the room, your room leader will start the introductions and explain the handraise function. You'll say your name, where you're from, your pronouns, what you do, if you're looking for work, and answer today's random question. Please only share what you're comfortable with.

We want to welcome all of our new friends! If you would like to join our Slack, please indicate in your introduction that this is your first Coffee Chat. You will then be asked to privately message your full name and email address to your breakout room's assigned notetaker. Later on today, you should receive a Slack invite from us.

Lastly, we're so grateful to our room leaders and notetakers, who are community members who volunteer their time. One of the things we love about this community is how we support each other in the ways we can. At about five minutes to the hour, we'll come back together as a big group for some closing announcements.

## During Breakout Rooms

The welcome announcements normally take us to around 10 minutes after the hour and we come back at 5 minutes to the hour, so the main session usually lasts for about 45 minutes.

## After Breakout Rooms

### Closing Announcements Script

> [!NOTE]
> Details for these announcements can be found on the [website's events calendar](https://virtualcoffee.io/events).

We want to be respectful of everyone's time, so we've got a couple of announcements before we leave. We just wrapped up [whatever event], and now we have some great things coming up: [list events].

If you have questions, please post them in the `#questions-about-vc` Slack channel. In addition, feel free to reach out to us at hello@virtualcoffee.io and follow us on Twitter [@VirtualCoffeeIO](https://x.com/VirtualCoffeeIO) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/virtual-coffee/). We're always here to support you!

Thank you all for being here and welcome to our new friends! Your breakout rooms notes will be posted in the Slack `#general` channel soon!

Have a great day, everyone!

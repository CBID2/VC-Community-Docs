Make Tech Writing A New Hire Requirement
### Description
I am proposing a new model for using technical blogging, friction logs, and other informal types of technical writing as a required part of a new-hire onboarding experience. 

I'll present an outline of how this plan would work in practice and explain the benefits to all parties. New hires learn more deeply, product engineering teams gain greater insight into UX/DX, new employees have a deliverable product during those nebulous early weeks of onboarding, and companies build a stronger content pipeline by identifying and nurturing strong writers. Everyone wins! 

If I were to go into private consulting, I think this model would be part of my 'unique value prop'. This talk is the start of working out the details in my proposal and getting feedback on the idea.

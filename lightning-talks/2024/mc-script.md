## EVENT INTRO

**MEG:**

Welcome everyone to the 2024 Virtual Coffee Lightning Talks! We're your hosts Meg and Bekah, and we're so excited to be here with you today! We're going to take a minute to tell you a bit about the Virtual Coffee community while people are tuning in and getting settled. But first, hi mom!

**BEKAH:**

Virtual Coffee started as a once a week zoom chat in April of 2020, and has grown into a community of devs at all stages of the journey, meeting, mentoring, hosting events, and most importantly, making friends. Our mission is to be a welcoming tech community that allows room for growth and mentorship at all levels, and to create meaningful opportunities for learning, leadership, and contribution for everyone. To find our code of conduct, events, or to learn more, you can check out our website virtualcoffee.io.

**MEG:**

We're about to wrap up our Find Your Voice monthly challenge, which was all about public speaking. In May, we're going to focus on one of my favorite monthly challenges: Community Kindness. This challenge encourages our members to celebrate one of the things that continually makes the Virtual Coffee community so special: Kindness.

We're so glad to have you all here with us today, and I especially want to thank our speakers for embracing the monthly challenge and signing up to give a talk. Without you, this event wouldn't be possible!

**BEKAH:**

Lightning Talks are meant to be an introduction to a topic. Here at Virtual Coffee we treat them as a good way to ease into public speaking or gauge interest for a possible Lunch & Learn topic, so today we won't be taking questions as part of the event. Instead, we'll be tagging the speaker and their topic in the #vc-events channel in Slack directly after their talk, so please feel free to add questions, comments, or general positivity there. We definitely still want to encourage usage of the livestream chat too, especially when speakers ask audience questions!

**MEG:**

Are you ready to kick this off, Bekah? I'm very excited about this first talk.

## INTERMISSION

<!-- ON START -->

**MEG:**

Thanks, James! I'm gonna go ahead and throw my mouse away now. Don't need it anymore!

Wow, six talks in and they've all been so full of interesting concepts and useful information!

**BEKAH:**

Yeah, for sure. With that last talk, we've hit the halfway mark in our Lightning Talks event. We're going to go ahead and take a quick 10 minute intermission, then meet you back here. Make sure you get up out of your seat, stretch out your arms and legs, and go get a glass of water, then meet us back here in 10 minutes. Startiiiinnnggg NOW!

<!-- ON RETURN -->

**MEG:**

I feel refreshed, how about you?

Before we dive back into it, I want to thank a few behind-the-scenes people who helped make this event today possible: Andy and Rafi for acting as mentors to our speakers, Lex for helping to moderate chat, Shelley for collecting info from speakers, Dan for setting up and testing the livestream, and Dan again plus Ryan who will work together to turn this giant recorded livestream into individual YouTube videos for people to watch at their leisure. You're all fantastic!

## OUTRO

**BEKAH:**

Thanks, Dan! I didn't know markdown had flavors! What a fun way to end our event.

Thank you all for being here today, especially our speakers. We look forward to keeping this discussion going in Slack. Check out the #vc-events channel or hop into the #co-working-room channel to discuss some of the talks you just watched.

And as a reminder, we're starting our Community Kindness monthly challenge in a few days. It's a fun one full of warm and fuzzies!

**MEG:**

As always if you have questions or comments, please feel free to reach out. We're always here to support you and to answer any question. You can ping us in Slack, on Twitter @VirtualCoffeeIO or email us at hello@virtualcoffee.io.

Have a great day, everyone!

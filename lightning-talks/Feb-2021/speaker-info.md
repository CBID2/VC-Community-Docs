## Talk Description: 
We all bring something to the table, a different perspective, a different experience, an opportunity to allow other people to grow by sharing our own perspectives, a skillset. And when we share our own experiences, when we leverage our backgrounds, not only do we offer others an opportunity to grow by understanding our perspective, but we also invite them to share their own perspectives so we can grow. And the depth created by approaching a problem from multiple perspectives is the growth and development we all should strive for.
Talking about taking non-tradition experiences, work-related or otherwise, and using that to gain confidence in learning to code and applying for jobs

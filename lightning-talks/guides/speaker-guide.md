## Tips for a Successful Talk

- **Prepare & Organize** – Do yourself a huge favor and plan out your talk! Peer review can help you to distill your thoughts down to the core of what you want to share. Take advantage of your fellow Lightning Talk speakers, the #co-working-room, and VC's Accountabilibuddies sessions to workshop your talks with members in the community.
- **Slides Are Optional** – Many speakers choose to use slides, but it is not required. If you use slides, remember that they are visual aides, not a teleprompter. Resist the urge to include more than 2-3 brief bullet points per slide.
- **Practice Out Loud** – Give your talk, start to finish, to your rubber ducky, your family, even your sink full of dishes! Then reflect, revise, and give it again.
- **Time Your Talk** – Lightning Talks should last from 5-15 minutes and cover a single topic.
- **Slow Down & Remember Your Audience** – Everyone watching knows you are amazing and can't wait to see your Lightning Talk. Take a breath, slow down, and speak to us, your friends at Virtual Coffee. :heart:

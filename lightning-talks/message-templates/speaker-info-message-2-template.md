Since this is a Lightning Talks session, we're not going to be taking questions. However, we're encouraging participants to ask questions by tagging you in the #event-chat channel. We encourage you to answer the questions as you're available or to consider submitting a [lunch & learn idea](https://virtualcoffee.io/lunch-and-learn-idea/) and letting the participants know that you're planning on developing your topic.

Lightning Talks will be on {day} between {time} EST. Please let us know if there are times after that that you prefer. We will do our best to accommodate everyone.

If you have any questions or comments, please let us know. As always, we want to support you in the ways that best suit your needs.

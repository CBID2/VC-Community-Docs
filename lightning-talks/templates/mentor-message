_This will be the message posted in the lightning-talk-mentor channel after mentors have been added_

Thank you all so much for volunteering to be mentors! We have created a couple of channels for clearer and more direct communication:

#lightning-talk-mentor channel. Please feel free to use this space to talk openly about mentoring or ask any questions you might have in order to best support the speaker(s) you're paired with.

#lightning-talk-speakers-and-mentors channel. Think of this as an open conversation room for you to support and cheer each other on, talk about the things you're excited about, ask for a second set of eyes, and to find larger group support.

Since each speaker will have individualized needs, please ask them what type of support they are hoping for. Some suggestions are idea and organization brainstorming, slide review--if they have them--talk rehearsal, and pacing.

Sometimes the hardest part is estimating time, so we encourage you to talk about this.

Each speaker also has a coordinator who will check-in with them as well. If you have any questions, please reach out. And thank you so much for support our speakers and the community!

# Monthly Challenge July 2021

## Theme
Demo In Public

## Description
VC Members learned to discuss and share their work throughout June and are now ready to move to the next level, demoing that work.

## Goals
The idea is to learn to communicate around a project, show the finished product or show the finished parts, give confidence and learn to be proud of any progress made. 

## How it works
The month will consist of 4 parts:
1. Define and set goals: decide what you want to share, define what is the scope and the result you want to reach at the end of the month. 
2. Start working: Once your demo project is defined you can start considering your demo plans. Share and celebrate your progress.
3. Reach your goal: Can you present to a group in VC? Would you prefer to pre-record it? Pick your demo method and make a commitment for the final week.
4. Present: Loom (Async) or Zoom (Sync)
> Weekly check-ins: Are you hitting your goals?

## FAQ

### Who participates?
Virtual Coffee's goal is to support all developers, no matter where they are in their coding journey. We encourage all members to participate.
This challenge can be done alone or in a group.

### How to share my progress?
Share your progress in the #monthly-challenge channel in Slack. While no other platform is imposed, it can be a good idea to also share on social media for more reach
but only if you are comfortable to do so (Twitter using -or not- the hashtag #demoinpublic, a personal blog, a post on [DEV.to](https://dev.to/), you get the idea).

Sharing every time some work is added is a good idea, small progress is still progress. No need to write a detailed blog post: a 140 characters Tweet can be enough. 
For example: "Today I added some styling. I used Bootstrap and implemented some cards to display the users in the home page".

### What if I need help?
You can ask a question in the #help-and-pairing VC channel, get 1:1 help during Office Hours (check #office-hours channel), join the VC coworking room... 
Asking for help is part of the process.

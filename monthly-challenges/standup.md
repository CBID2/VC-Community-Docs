 For June, the monthly challenge is to build in public. As part of this we would like to use Standup to keep each other informed on our progress.

 ## What is Stand up?
 A series of daily questions to give a quick update on your current progress. Usually held a start of the day so all team members can get a quick update on where everyone is. There is usually a set time limit and only one person talks at a time. This is often controlled by having an object like a book. Only the person holding the object is allowed to speak when they are done they pass the object around.

 The questions are.

 - What did you do yesterday?
 - What are you doing today?
 - Do you have any blockers?

 ## What did you do yesterday?
 What did you accomplish yesterday(since the last update)? 

 ## What are you doing today?
 - What do you plan to do today. Any particular goals you want to met before the end of day.

 ## Do you have any blockers?
 A blocker is something keeping you from your goal. A problem you need some help to resolve. Anything team mates can help with. Team members can give you some quick tips. For more involved answers you can set up a one on one discussion outside of the stand up. 

 ## Virtual Coffee Standup
 - For Virtual Coffee we plan to do something similar using Slack or Zoom.
